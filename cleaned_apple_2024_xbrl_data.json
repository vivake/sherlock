In the opinion of the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u00e2\u0080\u009cGAAP\u00e2\u0080\u009d) requires the use of management estimates.

There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to\n12\nmonths.\nTo protect the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s foreign currency\u00e2\u0080\u0093denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments.

Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches.

Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2025 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation, the impact of foreign currency loss regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in December 2024, and the tax impact from foreign currency revaluations related to the State Aid Decision.\nThe Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2025 was lower compared to the same quarter in 2024 due primarily to the

The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.\nDuring the first quarter of 2025, the Company repurchased $23.3 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.9 billion.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2025 Form 10-Q | 16\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\nIn November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u00e2\u0080\u009cFASB\u00e2\u0080\u009d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u00e2\u0080\u009cASU\u00e2\u0080\u009d) No. 2024-03,\nIncome Statement\u00e2\u0080\u0094Reporting Comprehensive Income\u00e2\u0080\u0094Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\n(\u00e2\u0080\u009cASU 2024-03\u00e2\u0080\u009d) and in January 2025, the FASB issued ASU No. 2025-01,\nIncome Statement\u00e2\u0080\u0094Reporting Comprehensive Income\u00e2\u0080\u0094Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Clarifying the Effective Date\n, which clarified the effective date of ASU 2024-03. ASU 2024-03 will require the Company to disclose the amounts of purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization, as applicable, included in certain expense captions in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, as well as qualitatively describe remaining amounts included in those captions. ASU 2024-03 will also require the Company to disclose both the amount and the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definition of selling expenses. The Company will adopt ASU 2024-03 in its fourth quarter of 2028 using a prospective transition method.\nIncome Taxes\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09,\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\n(\u00e2\u0080\u009cASU 2023-09\u00e2\u0080\u009d), which will require the Company to disclose specified additional information in its income tax rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 will also require the Company to disaggregate its income taxes paid disclosure by federal, state and foreign taxes, with further disaggregation required for significant individual jurisdictions. The Company will adopt ASU 2023-09 in its fourth quarter of 2026 using a prospective transition method.\nSegment Reporting\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07,\nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\n(\u00e2\u0080\u009cASU 2023-07\u00e2\u0080\u009d), which will require the Company to disclose segment expenses that are significant and regularly provided to the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief operating decision maker (\u00e2\u0080\u009cCODM\u00e2\u0080\u009d). In addition, ASU 2023-07 will require the Company to disclose the title and position of its CODM and how the CODM uses segment profit or loss information in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The Company will adopt ASU 2023-07 in its fourth quarter of 2025 using a retrospective transition method.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP and the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported.

The Commission\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investigations concern (1) Article 5(4) of the DMA, which relates to how developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed through the App Store as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users; and (2) Article 6(3) of the DMA, which relates to default settings, uninstallation of apps, and a web browser choice screen on iOS. On June 24, 2024, the Commission announced its preliminary findings in the Article 5(4) investigation alleging that the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s App Store rules are in breach of the DMA and announced that it had opened a third formal investigation against the Company regarding whether the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app marketplaces may violate the DMA. If the Commission makes a final determination that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose fines up to 10% of the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s annual worldwide net sales. Although any decision by the Commission can be appealed to the General Court of the EU, the effectiveness of the Commission\u00e2\u0080\u0099s order would apply immediately while the appeal is pending, unless a stay of the order is granted. The Company believes that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission.\nDepartment of Justice Lawsuit\nOn March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the \u00e2\u0080\u009cDOJ\u00e2\u0080\u009d) and a number of state and district attorneys general filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for \u00e2\u0080\u009cperformance smartphones\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009csmartphones\u00e2\u0080\u009d in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior. In addition,\nvarious civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S.\nalleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary damages and other nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\nEpic Games\nEpic Games, Inc. (\u00e2\u0080\u009cEpic\u00e2\u0080\u009d) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the \u00e2\u0080\u009cCalifornia District Court\u00e2\u0080\u009d) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unfair competition law based upon the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s App Store Review Guidelines violate California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS\n\u00c2\u00ae\nApp Store. On January 16, 2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District Court. A motion by Epic disputing the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s compliance plan and seeking to enforce the injunction, which the Company has opposed, is pending before the California District Court. On September 30, 2024, the Company filed a motion with the California District Court to narrow or vacate the injunction. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the first quarter of 2025 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expectations, the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2025 Form 10-Q | 18\nItem 1A.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Risk Factors\nThe Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2024 Form 10-K under the heading \u00e2\u0080\u009cRisk Factors.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s risk factors since the 2024 Form 10-K.\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business.\nThe Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects including antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti\u00e2\u0080\u0093money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; national security; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws, regulations, executive orders, directives, and enforcement priorities can adversely affect the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business by increasing the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s costs, limiting the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business or supply chain. New and changing laws, regulations, executive orders, directives, and enforcement priorities can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied.\nRisks and costs related to new and changing laws, regulations, executive orders, directives, and enforcement priorities may increase as the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services, or as the Company expands the use of technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence features, and must navigate new legal, regulatory and ethical considerations relating to such technologies. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nRegulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S. the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms.\nThe Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the App Store and Safari in the EU as it seeks to comply with the DMA, including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operating systems, and additional tools and application programming interfaces (\u00e2\u0080\u009cAPIs\u00e2\u0080\u009d) for developers. The Company has also continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission. Although the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s compliance plan is intended to address the DMA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obligations, it has been challenged by the Commission and may be challenged further by private litigants. The DMA provides for significant fines and penalties for noncompliance, and other jurisdictions may seek to require the Company to make changes to its business. While the changes introduced by the Company in the EU are intended to reduce new privacy and security risks that the DMA poses to EU users, many risks will remain.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2025 Form 10-Q | 19\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations and litigation in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is subject to civil antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for \u00e2\u0080\u009cperformance smartphones\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009csmartphones\u00e2\u0080\u009d generally in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. In addition, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations or litigation are resolved against the Company, the Company can be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make further changes to its business practices, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with Google LLC (\u00e2\u0080\u009cGoogle\u00e2\u0080\u009d) and other companies to offer their search services on the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings. On August 5, 2024, Google was found to have violated U.S. antitrust laws. In connection with this finding, the DOJ has proposed remedies, which include changes to Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s products, services and business models. The proposed changes vary in scope and severity and range from imposing significant restrictions on Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s licensing agreements to prohibiting Google from offering the Company commercial terms for search distribution for up to 10 years. If implemented, such remedies could materially adversely affect the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to earn revenue from such licensing arrangements.\nThere can be no assurance the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business, results of operations and financial condition will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings can negatively impact the reputation of the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s products and services, and result in harm to the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, lost sales, and lower profit margins.\nItem 2.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\nShare repurchase activity during the three months ended December\u00c2\u00a028, 2024 was as follows (in millions, except number of shares, which are reflected in thousands, and per-share amounts):\nPeriods\nTotal Number\nof Shares Purchased\nAverage Price\nPaid Per Share\nTotal Number of Shares\nPurchased as Part of Publicly\nAnnounced Plans or Programs\nApproximate Dollar Value of\nShares That May Yet Be Purchased\nUnder the Plans or Programs\n(1)\nSeptember 29, 2024 to November 2, 2024:\nOpen market and privately negotiated purchases\n41,627\n$\n229.51\n41,627\nNovember 3, 2024 to November 30, 2024:\nOpen market and privately negotiated purchases\n32,784\n$\n227.13\n32,784\nDecember 1, 2024 to December 28, 2024:\nOpen market and privately negotiated purchases\n25,379\n$\n248.05\n25,379\nTotal\n99,790\n$\n65,779\n(1)\nAs of December\u00c2\u00a028, 2024, the Company was authorized by the Board of Directors to purchase up to $110 billion of the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s common stock under a share repurchase program announced on May 2, 2024, of which $44.2 billion had been utilized.

    "A": "EX-10.2\n3\na10-qexhibit10212282024.htm\nEX-10.2\nDocument\nExhibit 10.2\nAPPLE INC.\nNON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR STOCK PLAN\n(as amended November 6, 2024)\nOn November 13, 2017, the Board adopted this Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (formerly known as the 1997 Director Stock Option Plan and the 1997 Director Stock Plan, and, as renamed, the \u00e2\u0080\u009c\nPlan\n\u00e2\u0080\u009d), subject to approval by the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shareholders at the Annual Meeting on February 13, 2018.  The Plan was further amended by the Board as set forth herein, effective November 6, 2024.  For the terms and conditions of the Plan applicable to an Award, refer to the version of the Plan in effect as of the date such Award was granted.\n1.\nPURPOSES\n.  The purposes of the Plan are to retain the services of qualified individuals who are not employees of the Company to serve as members of the Board and to secure for the Company the benefits of the incentives inherent in increased Common Stock ownership by such individuals by granting such individuals Awards in respect of Shares.\n2.\nADMINISTRATION\n.  The Administrator shall be responsible for administering the Plan.  Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Administrator shall have the full authority, in its sole discretion, to take any actions it deems necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan, including but not limited to:\n(a)\ndetermining the Fair Market Value for purposes of any Award;\n(b)\napproving any forms of Award Agreements to be used under the Plan;\n(c)\namending any outstanding Awards;\n(d)\nconstruing and interpreting the Plan and any agreements defining the rights and obligations of the Company and Non-Employee Directors under the Plan;\n(e)\ncorrecting any defect, supplying any omission or reconciling any inconsistency in the Plan or any Award Agreement;\n(f)\nadopting such rules or guidelines as it deems appropriate to implement the Plan;\n(g)\nauthorizing any person to execute on behalf of the Company any instrument required to effect the grant of an Award previously authorized by the Administrator or the Plan;\n(h)\nadjusting the number of shares subject to any Award, adjusting the price of any or all outstanding Options or otherwise changing previously imposed terms and conditions, in such circumstances as the Administrator may deem appropriate;\n(i)\ndetermining whether, and the extent to which, adjustments are required pursuant to Section 7 hereof; and\n(j)\nmaking all other decisions relating to the operation of the Plan.\nEach interpretation, determination, or other action made or taken by the Administrator pursuant to the Plan shall be final and binding on all persons, and the Administrator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s determinations under the Plan need not be the same for all persons.  The Administrator shall not be liable for any action or determination made in good faith, and shall be entitled to indemnification and reimbursement in the manner provided in the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws as such documents may be amended from time to time.\n1\n3.\nSHARES AVAILABLE; LIMITS\n.\n(a)\nSHARE LIMIT\n.  Subject to the provisions of Section 7, the maximum number of Shares that may be issued under the Plan shall not exceed 11,200,000 Shares (the \u00e2\u0080\u009c\nShare Limit\n\u00e2\u0080\u009d).  The stock issuable under the Plan shall be authorized and unissued Shares.\n(b)\nSHARE COUNT\n.  Shares issued pursuant to Restricted Stock Unit Awards shall count against the Share Limit as two (2) Shares for every one (1) Share issued in connection with the Award.  Shares issued pursuant to the exercise of Options shall count against the Share Limit as one (1) Share for every one (1) Share to which such exercise relates.  If Awards are settled in cash, the shares that would have been delivered had there been no cash settlement shall not be counted against the Share Limit.  Except as provided in the next sentence, if Awards are forfeited or are terminated for any reason before settlement or exercise, then the Shares underlying such Awards shall again become available for Awards under the Plan, provided that any one (1) Share subject to a Restricted Stock Unit Award that is forfeited or terminated shall be credited as two (2) Shares when determining the number of Shares that shall again become available for Awards under the Plan.  Shares that are exchanged by a Non-Employee Director or withheld by the Company as full or partial payment in connection with any Award under the Plan, as well as any Shares exchanged by a Non-Employee Director or withheld by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to any Award, shall not be available for subsequent Awards under the Plan.\n(c)\nLIMIT ON COMPENSATION.\nIn no event shall the compensation payable by the Company to a Non-Employee Director for services performed as a Non-Employee Director, including the grant date value (determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) of Awards, cash retainers, and other compensation, exceed $1,500,000 in the aggregate in any fiscal year.\n4.\nRESTRICTED STOCK UNITS\n.  Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, each Non-Employee Director shall receive grants of Restricted Stock Units under the Plan subject to the following provisions of this Section 4 and the terms of any Award Agreement approved by the Administrator:\n(a)\nANNUAL GRANTS\n.  On the date of each Annual Meeting immediately following which a Non-Employee Director is serving on the Board, such Non-Employee Director shall be automatically granted an Award of a number of Restricted Stock Units determined by dividing (i) $310,000 (or such other amount as determined by the Board and subject to the limitations of the Plan) by (ii)\u00c2\u00a0the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of grant, such number to be rounded to the nearest whole number of Restricted Stock Units (each, an \u00e2\u0080\u009c\nAnnual RSU Award\n\u00e2\u0080\u009d).\n(b)\nINITIAL GRANTS\n.  Each Non-Employee Director who first becomes a Non-Employee Director at any time other than on the date of an Annual Meeting shall be automatically granted, on the date he or she first becomes a Non-Employee Director, an Award of a number of Restricted Stock Units determined by multiplying (i) the quotient obtained by dividing (A)\u00c2\u00a0the dollar amount applied under Section 4(a) with respect to Awards granted at the immediately preceding Annual Meeting by (B)\u00c2\u00a0the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of grant, by (ii) a fraction (A)\u00c2\u00a0the numerator of which shall be the number of days remaining in the 365-day period following the most recent Annual Meeting, and (B)\u00c2\u00a0the denominator of which shall be 365 (but in no event shall such fraction be greater than one (1)), such number to be rounded to the nearest whole number of Restricted Stock Units (each, an \u00e2\u0080\u009c\nInitial RSU Award\n\u00e2\u0080\u009d); provided, however, that a Non-Employee Director shall not be eligible to receive an Initial RSU Award if either (x) he or she was an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to first becoming a Non-Employee Director, or (y) he or she first becomes a Non-Employee Director at any time on or after the February 1 following the last preceding Annual Meeting.\n2\n(c)\nVESTING; TERMINATION OF SERVICE\n.  Except as otherwise provided in an Award Agreement at the time of grant, each Annual RSU Award shall fully vest on the February 1 that occurs in the fiscal year of the Company following the fiscal year in which the Award was granted.  Each Initial RSU Award shall fully vest on the Vesting Date established for the Annual RSU Awards granted in connection with the last Annual Meeting to occur prior to the grant date of such Initial RSU Award.  If the Non-Employee Director ceases to serve as a member of the Board for any reason other than the Non-Employee Director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death, the Non-Employee Director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Restricted Stock Units shall terminate to the extent such Restricted Stock Units have not become vested prior to the first date the Non-Employee Director is no longer a member of the Board, and the Non-Employee Director shall have no rights with respect to, or in respect of, such terminated Restricted Stock Units.  If the Non-Employee Director ceases to serve as a member of the Board due to his or her death, the Non-Employee Director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unvested Restricted Stock Units shall fully vest as of the date of the Non-Employee Director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death.\n(d)\nSETTLEMENT OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS\n.

Except for any Dividend Equivalent Rights awarded pursuant to Section 4(f) or as provided in Section 7, no adjustment shall be made in respect of any Restricted Stock Units for dividends or distributions or other rights in respect of any share for which the record date is prior to the date upon which the Non-Employee Director shall become the holder of record of Shares related thereto.\n(f)\nDIVIDEND EQUIVALENT RIGHTS DISTRIBUTIONS\n.  As of any date that the Company pays an ordinary cash dividend on its Common Stock, the Company shall credit the Non-Employee Directors with a dollar amount equal to (i) the per Share cash dividend paid by the Company on its Common Stock on such date, multiplied by (ii) the total number of Restricted Stock Units (including as such total number may be adjusted pursuant to Section 7) subject to the Award that are outstanding immediately prior to the record date for that dividend (a \u00e2\u0080\u009c\nDividend Equivalent Right\n\u00e2\u0080\u009d).  Any Dividend Equivalent Rights credited pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 4(f) shall be subject to the same vesting, settlement and other terms, conditions and restrictions as the Restricted Stock Units to which they relate; provided, however, that the amount of any vested Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be paid in cash.  No crediting of Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be made pursuant to this Section 4(f) with respect to any Restricted Stock Units which, immediately prior to the record date for that dividend, have either been paid pursuant to Section 4(d) or terminated pursuant to Section 4(c).\n5.\nOPTIONS.\n(a)\nNO ADDITIONAL GRANTS\n.

At the end of such ninety-day period, any unexercised portion of the Option shall expire.

The date of exercise of an Option shall be the later of (A)\u00c2\u00a0the date on which the Company receives such written notice and (B)\u00c2\u00a0the date on which the Non-Employee Director pays the applicable consideration pursuant to Section 5(e)(ii).\nii.\nMETHOD OF EXERCISE\n.  The consideration to be paid for the Shares to be issued upon exercise of an Option may consist of (A)\u00c2\u00a0cash, (B)\u00c2\u00a0check, (C)\u00c2\u00a0other Shares that have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as to which the Option shall be exercised, (D)\u00c2\u00a0delivery of a properly executed exercise notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to sell Shares and promptly deliver to the Company the amount of proceeds required to pay the exercise price, or (E)\u00c2\u00a0any combination of the foregoing methods of payment.  Without limiting the generality of the\n4\nforegoing, any vested and exercisable Options may also be Net Exercised, to the extent permitted by the Administrator.\niii.\nSHAREHOLDER RIGHTS\n.  A Non-Employee Director shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to any Shares issuable upon exercise of an Option until such Shares shall have been issued to the Non-Employee Director pursuant to Section 5(e), and, except as provided in Section 7, no adjustment shall be made to an Option or Share issued upon the exercise thereof for dividends, distributions or other rights in respect of any Share for which the record date is prior to the date upon which the Non-Employee Director shall become the holder of record thereof.\n(f)\nISSUANCE OF SHARES\n.  Subject to the foregoing conditions, as soon as is reasonably practicable after its receipt of a proper notice of exercise and, if applicable, payment of the exercise price of the Option for the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised, the Company shall deliver to the Non-Employee Director (or following the Non-Employee Director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death, the Beneficiary entitled to exercise the Option), at the principal office of the Company or at such other location as may be acceptable to the Company and the Non-Employee Director (or such Beneficiary), the appropriate number of Shares to be issued in connection with such exercise.  Delivery of such Shares shall be evidenced by an appropriate entry on the books of the Company or a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company, or in such other manner that the Administrator shall specify from time to time.  Shares sold in connection with a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccashless exercise\u00e2\u0080\u009d shall be delivered to the broker referred to therein in accordance with procedures established by the Company from time to time.\n6.\nRESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER\n.  An Award may not be transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise disposed of, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution; provided, however, that, with the approval of the Administrator\n,\nan Award may be transferred to a Non-Employee Director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family members or to one or more trusts established in whole or in part for the benefit of one or more of such family members.  An Option shall be exercisable, during the Non-Employee Director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lifetime, only by the Non-Employee Director or by the individual or entity to whom the Option has been transferred in accordance with the previous sentence.  No assignment or transfer of an Award, or of the rights represented thereby, whether voluntary or involuntary, by operation of law or otherwise, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, shall vest in the assignee or transferee any interest or right in the Award, but immediately upon any attempt to assign or transfer the Award the same shall terminate and be of no force or effect.\n7.\nADJUSTMENTS\n.\n(a)\nUpon (or, as may be necessary to effect the adjustment, immediately prior to)  any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a stock split in the form of a stock dividend) or reverse stock split; any merger, combination, consolidation or other reorganization; any spin-off, split-up, split-off or extraordinary dividend distribution in respect of the Common Stock; or any exchange of Common Stock or other securities of the Company, or any similar, unusual or extraordinary corporate transaction in respect of the Common Stock, the Administrator shall equitably and proportionately adjust (1)\u00c2\u00a0the number and type of Shares (or other securities) that thereafter may be made the subject of Awards (including the Share Limit, maximums and number of Shares set forth elsewhere in the Plan), (2)\u00c2\u00a0the number, amount and type of Shares (or other securities or property) subject to any outstanding Awards, (3)\u00c2\u00a0the exercise price of any outstanding Options, and/or (4)\u00c2\u00a0the securities, cash or other property deliverable upon exercise or settlement of any outstanding Awards, in each case to the extent necessary to preserve (but not increase) the level of incentives intended by the Plan and the then-outstanding Awards.  Any good faith determination by the Administrator as to whether an adjustment is required in the\n5\ncircumstances pursuant to this Section 7(a), and the extent and nature of any such adjustment, shall be conclusive and binding on all persons.\n(b)\nIt is intended that, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, any adjustments contemplated by Section 7(a) be made in a manner that satisfies applicable legal, tax (including, without limitation and as applicable in the circumstances, Code Section\u00c2\u00a0409A) and accounting (so as to not\ntrigger any charge to earnings with respect to such adjustment) requirements.\n(c)\nAny adjustment under this Section 7 need not be the same for all persons or Awards.\n8.\nCHANGE OF CONTROL\n.  Upon the occurrence of any Change of Control, any then outstanding Award automatically shall become vested or exercisable, as the case may be, with respect to a prorated portion of the number of Shares subject to such Award, determined as follows:\n(a)\nCLIFF-VESTING AWARDS.\nIf the Award has one scheduled Vesting Date, the portion of the Award with respect to the following number of Shares shall vest upon the Change of Control:  (i)\u00c2\u00a0the number of Shares subject to such Award, multiplied by (ii)\u00c2\u00a0a fraction (A)\u00c2\u00a0the numerator of which is the number of days elapsed from and including the date the Award was granted to the date of the Change of Control, and (B)\u00c2\u00a0the denominator is the number of days from and including the date of grant to and including the scheduled Vesting Date.\n(b)\nINSTALLMENT-VESTING AWARDS.\nIf the Award has multiple scheduled Vesting Dates, the portion of the Award with respect to the following number of Shares shall vest upon the Change of Control:  (i)\u00c2\u00a0the number of Shares subject to the portion of such Award that is scheduled to vest on the first Vesting Date that is scheduled to occur following the Change of Control, multiplied by (ii)\u00c2\u00a0a fraction (A)\u00c2\u00a0the numerator of which is the number of days elapsed following and excluding the most recent Vesting Date prior to the Change of Control, and (B)\u00c2\u00a0the denominator is the number of days from and excluding such most recent Vesting Date to and including the first Vesting Date that is scheduled to occur following the Change of Control.\n9.\nDESIGNATION OF BENEFICIARY\n.\n(a)\nBENEFICIARY DESIGNATIONS\n.  Each Non-Employee Director may designate a Beneficiary to exercise an Option or receive settlement of an Award upon the Non-Employee Director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death by executing a Beneficiary Designation Form and delivering it to the Administrator.\n(b)\nCHANGE OF BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION\n.  A Non-Employee Director may change an earlier Beneficiary designation by executing a later Beneficiary Designation Form and delivering it to the Administrator.  The execution of a Beneficiary Designation Form and its receipt by the Administrator shall revoke and rescind any prior Beneficiary Designation Form.\n10.\nTERMINATION AND AMENDMENT OF THE PLAN\n.\n(a)\nTERMINATION\n.  Unless earlier terminated by the Board, the Plan shall terminate on November 12, 2027.

For avoidance of doubt, the Board may, without shareholder approval, provide on a prospective basis for grants under the Plan to consist of Options only, Restricted Stock Units only, or a combination of Options and Restricted Stock Units on such terms and conditions, subject to the Share Limit and the other express limits of the Plan, as may be established by the Board.\n(c)\nWHEN NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS\u00e2\u0080\u0099 CONSENTS REQUIRED\n.  The Board may not alter, amend, suspend or terminate the Plan, or amend the terms of any outstanding Award, without the consent of any Non-Employee Director to the extent that such action would adversely affect his or her rights with respect to Awards that have previously been granted, except to the extent such action is necessary to comply with applicable law or stock exchange listing rules or accounting rules.\n(d)\nNO REPRICING\n.  In no case (except due to an adjustment contemplated by Section 7 or any repricing that may be approved by shareholders) shall any action be taken with respect to the Plan or any Option hereunder that would constitute a repricing (by amendment, substitution, cancellation and regrant, exchange or other means, including any action that is treated as a repricing under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) of the per Share exercise price of any Option.\n11.\nMISCELLANEOUS\n.\n(a)\nNO RIGHT TO NOMINATION\n.  Nothing in the Plan shall be deemed to create any obligation on the part of the Board to nominate any of its members for reelection by the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shareholders, nor confer upon any Non-Employee Director the right to remain a member of the Board for any period of time, or at any particular rate of compensation.\n(b)\nREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\n.  The Administrator may require each Non-Employee Director or any other person purchasing or acquiring Shares pursuant to the Plan to agree with the Company in writing that such Non-Employee Director is acquiring the Shares for investment and not with a view to the distribution thereof or provide such other assurances and representations to the Company as the Administrator may deem necessary or desirable to assure compliance with all applicable legal and accounting requirements.  Shares delivered under the Plan shall be subject to such stock-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Administrator may deem advisable under the rules, regulations and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission or any exchange upon which the Common Stock is then listed, and any applicable federal or state securities law.  No Shares shall be issued hereunder unless the Company shall have determined that such issuance is in compliance with, or pursuant to an exemption from, all applicable federal and state securities laws.\n(c)\nEXPENSES\n.  The costs and expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by the Company.\n7\n(d)\nAPPLICABLE LAW\n.  Except as to matters of federal law, the Plan and all actions taken thereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without giving effect to conflicts of law principles.\n(e)\nSEVERABILITY.\nIf a court of competent jurisdiction holds any provision invalid and unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Plan shall continue in effect.\n(f)\nSECTION HEADINGS; INTERPRETATION\n.

Notwithstanding any provisions of the Plan to the contrary, no Participant shall be granted an Option to purchase Shares under this Plan if such Participant (or any other person whose stock would be attributed to such Participant pursuant to Section 424(d) of the Code), immediately after such Option is granted, would own or hold options to purchase Shares possessing five percent (5%) or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.\n(e)\nOther Limitation.  The Administrator may determine, as to any Offering Period, that the offering will not be extended to \u00e2\u0080\u009chighly compensated employees\u00e2\u0080\u009d within the meaning of Section 414(q) of the Code.\n(6)\nParticipation in the Plan.

Such Enrollment Agreement shall contain the payroll deduction authorization described in Section (8).  A payroll deduction authorization will be effective for the first Offering Period following the submission\n7\nof the Enrollment Agreement and all subsequent Offering Periods as provided by Section (7) until (i) it is terminated in accordance with Sections (9) or (14), (ii) it is modified by filing another Enrollment Agreement in accordance with this Section (6), (iii) an election is made to decrease payroll deductions in accordance with Section (8), (iv) the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Termination of Service, or (v) the Participant is otherwise ineligible to participate in the Plan.\n(7)\nAutomatic Re-Enrollment.  Following the end of each Offering Period, each Participant shall be automatically re-enrolled in the next Offering Period at the applicable rate of payroll deductions in effect on the last Trading Day of the prior Offering Period or otherwise as provided under Section (8), unless (i) the Participant has elected to withdraw from the Plan in accordance with Section (9), (ii) the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Termination of Service, or (iii) the Participant is otherwise ineligible to participate in the next Offering Period.

Payroll deductions shall commence on the Offering Date of the first Offering Period to which the Enrollment Agreement relates (or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter) and shall continue through subsequent Offering Periods pursuant to Section (7).  Participants shall not be permitted to make any separate cash payments into their Account for the purchase of Shares pursuant to an offering.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if local law prohibits payroll deductions, a Participant may elect to participate in an Offering Period through contributions to his or her Account in a format and pursuant to a process acceptable to the Administrator.  In such event, any such Participant shall be deemed to participate in a separate offering under the Plan, unless the Administrator otherwise expressly provides.\nIf in any payroll period a Participant has no pay or his or her pay is insufficient (after other authorized deductions) to permit deduction of the full amount of his or her payroll deduction election, then (i) the payroll deduction election for such payroll period shall be reduced to the amount of pay remaining, if any, after all other authorized deductions, and (ii) the percentage or dollar amount of Eligible Compensation shall be deemed to have been reduced by the amount of the reduction in the payroll deduction election for such payroll period.  Deductions of the full amount originally elected by the Participant will recommence as soon as his or her pay is sufficient to permit such payroll deductions; provided, however, no additional amounts will be deducted to satisfy the Outstanding Election.\nA Participant may elect to decrease, but not increase, the rate of his or her payroll deductions during an Offering Period by submitting the prescribed Enrollment Agreement to the Company (or the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s designee) at any time\n8\nprior to the first day of the last calendar month of such Offering Period.  Any such payroll deduction change will be effective as soon as administratively practicable thereafter and will remain in effect for successive Offering Periods as provided in Section (7) unless (i) the Participant submits a new Enrollment Agreement for a later Offering Period, (ii) the Participant elects to decrease his or her payroll deductions, (iii) the Participants elects to withdraw from the Plan in accordance with Section (9), (iv) the Participant is withdrawn from the Plan in accordance with Section (14), or (v) the Participant is otherwise ineligible to participate in the Plan.  A Participant may only increase his or her rate of payroll deductions to be effective for the next Offering Period by completing and filing with the Company a new Enrollment Agreement authorizing the payroll deductions.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may adjust a Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s payroll deductions at any time during an Offering Period to the extent necessary to comply with Section 423(b)(8) of the Code and the limitations of Section (5).  Payroll deductions will recommence and be made in accordance with the Outstanding Election in place prior to such Company adjustment starting with the first Offering Period that begins in the next calendar year (or such other time as is determined by the Administrator) unless (i) the Participant withdraws in accordance with Section (9), (ii) the Participant is withdrawn from the Plan in accordance with Section (14), or (iii) the Participant is otherwise ineligible to participate in the Plan.\n(9)\nWithdrawal from Offering Period After Offering Date.  An Eligible Employee may withdraw from any Offering Period after the applicable Offering Date, in whole but not in part, at any time prior to the date specified by the Administrator or, if no such date is specified by the Administrator, the last Trading Day of such Offering Period, by submitting the prescribed withdrawal notice to the Company (or the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s designee), in the format and pursuant to the process as prescribed by the Administrator.  If a Participant withdraws from an Offering Period, the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Option for such Offering Period will automatically be terminated, and the Company will refund in cash the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entire Account balance for such Offering Period as soon as practicable thereafter.  A Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s withdrawal from a particular Offering Period shall be irrevocable.  If a Participant wishes to participate in a subsequent Offering Period, he or she must re-enroll in the Plan by timely submitting a new Enrollment Agreement in accordance with Section (6).\n(10)\nPurchase of Stock.  On the last Trading Day of each Offering Period, the Administrator shall cause the amount credited to each Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Account to be applied to purchase as many Shares (or, as applicable, fractions of a Share) pursuant to the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Option as possible at the Purchase Price Per Share, subject to limitations of Sections (3) and (5).  In no event may Shares be purchased pursuant to an Option more than twenty-seven (27) months after the Offering Date of such Option.  The amount applied to purchase Shares pursuant to the Option shall be deducted from the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Account.

In the event the Company or its shareholders enter into an agreement to dispose of all or substantially all of the assets or outstanding capital stock of the Company by means of a sale, merger, or reorganization in which the Company will not be the surviving corporation (other than a reorganization effected primarily to change the State in which the Company is incorporated, a merger or consolidation with a wholly-owned Subsidiary, or any other transaction in which there is no substantial change in the shareholders of the Company or their relative stock holdings, regardless of whether the Company is the surviving corporation) or in the event the Company is liquidated, then all outstanding Options under the Plan shall automatically be exercised immediately prior to the consummation of such sale, merger, reorganization, or liquidation (deemed the end of the Offering Period in such case) by causing all amounts credited to each Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Account to be applied to purchase as many Shares pursuant to the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Option as possible at the Purchase Price Per Share, subject to the limitations of Sections (3) and (5).\n11\n(19)\nAcquisitions and Dispositions.

This Plan and any offering and sales of Shares or delivery of Shares under this Plan to Eligible Employees hereunder are subject to any governmental or regulatory approvals or consents that may be or become applicable in connection therewith.\n(21)\nPlan Amendment, Suspension, and Termination.  The Board may, from time to time, amend, suspend, or terminate the Plan in any manner it deems necessary or advisable; provided, however, that no such action shall adversely affect any then outstanding and vested Options under the Plan unless such action is required to comply with Applicable Laws; and provided, further, that no such action of the Board shall be effective without the approval of the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shareholders if such approval is required by Applicable Laws.

Participants shall not be permitted to make any separate cash payments into their Account for the purchase of Shares pursuant to an offering.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if local law prohibits payroll deductions, a Participant may elect to participate in an Offering Period through contributions to his or her Account in a format and pursuant to a process acceptable to the Administrator.  In such event, any such Participant shall be deemed to participate in a separate offering under the Plan, unless the Administrator otherwise expressly provides.\nIf in any payroll period a Participant has no pay or his or her pay is insufficient (after other authorized deductions) to permit deduction of the full amount of his or her payroll deduction election, then (i) the payroll deduction election for such payroll period shall be reduced to the amount of pay remaining, if any, after all other authorized deductions, and (ii) the percentage or dollar amount of Eligible Compensation shall be deemed to have been reduced by the amount of the reduction in the payroll deduction election for such payroll period.  Deductions of the full amount originally elected by the Participant will recommence as soon as his or her pay is sufficient to permit such payroll deductions; provided, however, no additional amounts will be deducted to satisfy the Outstanding Election.\nA Participant may elect to decrease, but not increase, the rate of his or her payroll deductions during an Offering Period by submitting the prescribed Enrollment Agreement to the Company (or the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s designee) at any time\n8\nprior to the first day of the last calendar month of such Offering Period.  Any such payroll deduction change will be effective as soon as administratively practicable thereafter and will remain in effect for successive Offering Periods as provided in Section (7) unless (i) the Participant submits a new Enrollment Agreement for a later Offering Period, (ii) the Participant elects to decrease his or her payroll deductions, (iii) the Participants elects to withdraw from the Plan in accordance with Section (9), (iv) the Participant is withdrawn from the Plan in accordance with Section (14), or (v) the Participant is otherwise ineligible to participate in the Plan.  A Participant may only increase his or her rate of payroll deductions to be effective for the next Offering Period by completing and filing with the Company a new Enrollment Agreement authorizing the payroll deductions.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may adjust a Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s payroll deductions at any time during an Offering Period to the extent necessary to comply with Section 423(b)(8) of the Code and the limitations of Section (5).  Payroll deductions will recommence and be made in accordance with the Outstanding Election in place prior to such Company adjustment starting with the first Offering Period that begins in the next calendar year (or such other time as is determined by the Administrator) unless (i) the Participant withdraws in accordance with Section (9), (ii) the Participant is withdrawn from the Plan in accordance with Section (14), or (iii) the Participant is otherwise ineligible to participate in the Plan.\n(9)\nWithdrawal from Offering Period After Offering Date.  An Eligible Employee may withdraw from any Offering Period after the applicable Offering Date, in whole but not in part, at any time prior to the date specified by the Administrator or, if no such date is specified by the Administrator, the last Trading Day of such Offering Period, by submitting the prescribed withdrawal notice to the Company (or the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s designee), in the format and pursuant to the process as prescribed by the Administrator.  If a Participant withdraws from an Offering Period, the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Option for such Offering Period will automatically be terminated, and the Company will refund in cash the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entire Account balance for such Offering Period as soon as practicable thereafter.  A Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s withdrawal from a particular Offering Period shall be irrevocable.  If a Participant wishes to participate in a subsequent Offering Period, he or she must re-enroll in the Plan by timely submitting a new Enrollment Agreement in accordance with Section (6).\n(10)\nPurchase of Stock.  On the last Trading Day of each Offering Period, the Administrator shall cause the amount credited to each Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Account to be applied to purchase as many Shares (or, as applicable, fractions of a Share) pursuant to the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Option as possible at the Purchase Price Per Share, subject to limitations of Sections (3) and (5).  In no event may Shares be purchased pursuant to an Option more than twenty-seven (27) months after the Offering Date of such Option.  The amount applied to purchase Shares pursuant to the Option shall be deducted from the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Account.  Any amounts remaining credited to the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Account on the last Trading Day of the Offering Period shall be retained in the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Account and rolled forward to the next Offering Period.\n9\n(11)\nInterest on Payments.  No interest shall be paid on sums withheld from a Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pay for the purchase of Shares under this Plan unless otherwise determined necessary by the Administrator.\n(12)\nRights as Shareholder.  A Participant will not be a shareholder or have any rights as a shareholder with respect to Shares subject to the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Options issued under the Plan until the Shares are purchased pursuant to the Options and such Shares are transferred into the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name on the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s books and records.\n(13)\nOptions Not Transferable.  A Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Options under this Plan may not be sold, pledged, assigned, or transferred in any manner.  If a Participant sells, pledges, assigns, or transfers his or her Options in violation of this Section (13), such Options shall immediately terminate, and the Participant shall immediately receive a refund of the amount then credited to the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Account.\n(14)\nDeemed Cancellations.\n(a)\nTermination of Service.  In the event of a Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Termination of Service, (i) any outstanding Option held by the Participant shall immediately terminate; (ii) the Participant shall be withdrawn from the Plan; and (iii) the Participant shall receive a refund of the amount then credited to the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Account.\n(b)\nDeath of a Participant.  If a Participant dies, (i) any outstanding Option held by the Participant shall immediately terminate, and (ii) the Participant shall be withdrawn from the Plan.  As soon as administratively practicable after the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death, the amount then credited to the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Account shall be remitted to the executor, administrator, or other legal representative of the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s estate or, if the Administrator permits a beneficiary designation, to the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by the Participant if such designation has been filed with the Company or the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s designee before such Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death.  If such executor, administrator, or other legal representative of the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s estate has not been appointed (to the knowledge of the Company) or if the beneficiary or beneficiaries are no longer living at the time of the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death, the Company, in its discretion, may deliver the outstanding Account balance to the spouse or to any one or more dependents or relatives of the Participant or to such other person as the Company may designate.\n(15)\nApplication of Funds.  All funds received by the Company in payment for Shares purchased under this Plan and held by the Company at any time may be used for any valid corporate purpose.\n(16)\nNo Employment/Service Rights.  Neither the action of the Company in establishing the Plan, nor any action taken under the Plan by the Board or the Administrator, nor any provision of the Plan itself, shall be construed so as to\n10\ngrant any person the right to remain in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary for any period of specific duration, and such person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s employment may be terminated at any time, with or without cause.\n(17)\nAdjustments.  Subject to Section (18), upon (or, as may be necessary to effect the adjustment, immediately prior to) any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a stock split in the form of a stock dividend) or reverse stock split; any merger, combination, consolidation, or other reorganization; any spin-off, split-up, or similar extraordinary dividend distribution in respect of the Common Stock; or any exchange of Common Stock or other securities of the Company or any similar, unusual, or extraordinary corporate transaction in respect of the Common Stock, in each case, then the Administrator shall equitably and proportionately adjust (1) the number, amount, and type of Shares of Common Stock (or other securities) that thereafter may be made the subject of Options (including the specific Share limits, maximums, and numbers of Shares set forth elsewhere in the Plan), (2) the number, amount, and type of Shares of Common Stock (or other securities or property) subject to any outstanding Options, (3) the Purchase Price Per Share of any outstanding Options, and/or (4) the securities, cash, or other property deliverable upon exercise or payment of any outstanding Options, in each case to the extent necessary to preserve (but not increase) the level of incentives intended by the Plan and the then-outstanding Options.\nIt is intended that, if possible, any adjustments contemplated by the preceding paragraph be made in a manner that satisfies applicable legal, tax (including, without limitation and as applicable in the circumstances, Section 424 of the Code and Section 409A of the Code), and accounting (so as to not trigger any charge to earnings with respect to such adjustment) requirements.\nWithout limiting the generality of Section (4), any good faith determination by the Administrator as to whether an adjustment is required in the circumstances pursuant to this Section (17), and the extent and nature of any such adjustment, shall be final, conclusive, and binding on all persons.\n(18)\nMerger or Liquidation of Company.  In the event the Company or its shareholders enter into an agreement to dispose of all or substantially all of the assets or outstanding capital stock of the Company by means of a sale, merger, or reorganization in which the Company will not be the surviving corporation (other than a reorganization effected primarily to change the State in which the Company is incorporated, a merger or consolidation with a wholly-owned Subsidiary, or any other transaction in which there is no substantial change in the shareholders of the Company or their relative stock holdings, regardless of whether the Company is the surviving corporation) or in the event the Company is liquidated, then all outstanding Options under the Plan shall automatically be exercised immediately prior to the consummation of such sale, merger, reorganization, or liquidation (deemed the end of the Offering Period in such case) by causing all amounts credited to each Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Account to be applied to purchase as many Shares pursuant to the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Option as possible at the Purchase Price Per Share, subject to the limitations of Sections (3) and (5).\n11\n(19)\nAcquisitions and Dispositions.  The Administrator may, in its sole and absolute discretion and in accordance with principles under Section 423 of the Code, create special Offering Periods for individuals who become Eligible Employees solely in connection with the acquisition of another company or business by merger, reorganization, or purchase of assets, and notwithstanding Section (14), may provide for special purchase dates for Participants who will cease to be Eligible Employees solely in connection with the disposition of all or a portion of any Designated Subsidiary or a portion of the Company, which Offering Periods and purchase rights granted pursuant thereto shall, notwithstanding anything stated herein, be subject to such terms and conditions as the Administrator considers appropriate in the circumstances.\n(20)\nGovernment Approvals or Consents.  This Plan and any offering and sales of Shares or delivery of Shares under this Plan to Eligible Employees hereunder are subject to any governmental or regulatory approvals or consents that may be or become applicable in connection therewith.\n(21)\nPlan Amendment, Suspension, and Termination.  The Board may, from time to time, amend, suspend, or terminate the Plan in any manner it deems necessary or advisable; provided, however, that no such action shall adversely affect any then outstanding and vested Options under the Plan unless such action is required to comply with Applicable Laws; and provided, further, that no such action of the Board shall be effective without the approval of the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shareholders if such approval is required by Applicable Laws.  Upon the termination of the Plan, any balance in a Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Account shall be refunded to him or her as soon as practicable thereafter.\n(22)\nGoverning Law.  The Plan shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of California (except its choice-of-law provisions) and applicable U.S. Federal laws.\n12",

Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Administrator shall have full authority, in its sole discretion, to take any actions it deems necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan, including, but not limited to:\n(a)\nInterpreting the Plan and prescribing, adopting, and rescinding rules and regulations it deems appropriate to implement the Plan, including amending any outstanding Option, as it may deem advisable or necessary to comply with Applicable Laws, and making all other decisions relating to the operation of the Plan;\n(b)\nEstablishing the timing and length of Offering Periods;\n(c)\nEstablishing minimum and maximum contribution rates;\n(d)\nEstablishing new or changing existing limits on the number of Shares an Eligible Employee may elect to purchase with respect to any Offering Period, if such limits are announced prior to the first Offering Period to be affected;\n(e)\nAdopting such rules or sub-plans as may be deemed necessary or appropriate to comply with the laws of other countries, allow for tax-preferred treatment of the Options or otherwise provide for the participation by Eligible Employees who reside outside of the United States, including determining which Eligible Employees are eligible to participate in the Non-423(b) Offering or other sub-plans established by the Administrator; and\n(f)\nEstablishing the exchange ratio applicable to amounts withheld in a currency other than U.S. dollars and permitting payroll withholding in excess of the amount designated by a Participant in order to adjust for delays or mistakes in the processing of properly completed Enrollment Agreements.\nThe Administrator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s determinations under the Plan shall be final, conclusive, and binding on all persons.  Neither the Board, the People and Compensation Committee of the Board, any other committee appointed by the Board, nor any of their agents or designees shall be\n6\nliable for any act, failure to act, or determination made in good faith with respect to the Plan.\n(5)\nGrant of Option; Limitations.\n(a)\nGrant of Option.  On each Offering Date, each Participant shall automatically be granted an Option to purchase as many Shares (or, as applicable, fractions of a Share) as the Participant will be able to purchase with the payroll deductions credited to the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Account during the applicable Offering Period.\n(b)\nLimit on Number of Shares Purchased.  Notwithstanding the above, in no event may a Participant purchase more than one million (1,000,000) Shares in any one Offering Period, unless otherwise expressly provided by the Administrator in advance of that Offering Period.\n(c)\nLimit on Value of Shares Purchased.  Notwithstanding any provisions of the Plan to the contrary, excluding Options granted pursuant to any Non-423(b) Offering, no Participant shall be granted an Option to purchase Shares under this Plan which permits the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rights to purchase Shares under all \u00e2\u0080\u009cemployee stock purchase plans\u00e2\u0080\u009d (described in Section\u00c2\u00a0423 of the Code) of the Company and its Subsidiaries to accrue at a rate which exceeds twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) of the Fair Market Value of such Shares (determined at the time such Options are granted) for each calendar year in which such Options are outstanding at any time.\n(d)\n5% Owner Limit.  Notwithstanding any provisions of the Plan to the contrary, no Participant shall be granted an Option to purchase Shares under this Plan if such Participant (or any other person whose stock would be attributed to such Participant pursuant to Section 424(d) of the Code), immediately after such Option is granted, would own or hold options to purchase Shares possessing five percent (5%) or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.\n(e)\nOther Limitation.  The Administrator may determine, as to any Offering Period, that the offering will not be extended to \u00e2\u0080\u009chighly compensated employees\u00e2\u0080\u009d within the meaning of Section 414(q) of the Code.\n(6)\nParticipation in the Plan.  An Eligible Employee may become a Participant for an Offering Period by completing the prescribed Enrollment Agreement and submitting such Enrollment Agreement to the Company (or the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s designee), in the format and pursuant to the process as prescribed by the Administrator, during the Enrollment Period prior to the commencement of the Offering Period to which it relates.  Such Enrollment Agreement shall contain the payroll deduction authorization described in Section (8).  A payroll deduction authorization will be effective for the first Offering Period following the submission\n7\nof the Enrollment Agreement and all subsequent Offering Periods as provided by Section (7) until (i) it is terminated in accordance with Sections (9) or (14), (ii) it is modified by filing another Enrollment Agreement in accordance with this Section (6), (iii) an election is made to decrease payroll deductions in accordance with Section (8), (iv) the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Termination of Service, or (v) the Participant is otherwise ineligible to participate in the Plan.\n(7)\nAutomatic Re-Enrollment.  Following the end of each Offering Period, each Participant shall be automatically re-enrolled in the next Offering Period at the applicable rate of payroll deductions in effect on the last Trading Day of the prior Offering Period or otherwise as provided under Section (8), unless (i) the Participant has elected to withdraw from the Plan in accordance with Section (9), (ii) the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Termination of Service, or (iii) the Participant is otherwise ineligible to participate in the next Offering Period.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator may require current Participants to complete and submit a new Enrollment Agreement at any time it deems necessary or desirable to facilitate Plan administration or for any other reason.\n(8)\nPayroll Deductions.  Each Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Enrollment Agreement shall contain a payroll deduction authorization pursuant to which he or she shall elect to have a designated whole percentage of Eligible Compensation between one percent (1%) and ten percent (10%) deducted on each payday during the Offering Period and credited to the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Account for the purchase of Shares pursuant to the offering.  Payroll deductions shall commence on the Offering Date of the first Offering Period to which the Enrollment Agreement relates (or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter) and shall continue through subsequent Offering Periods pursuant to Section (7).  Participants shall not be permitted to make any separate cash payments into their Account for the purchase of Shares pursuant to an offering.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if local law prohibits payroll deductions, a Participant may elect to participate in an Offering Period through contributions to his or her Account in a format and pursuant to a process acceptable to the Administrator.  In such event, any such Participant shall be deemed to participate in a separate offering under the Plan, unless the Administrator otherwise expressly provides.\nIf in any payroll period a Participant has no pay or his or her pay is insufficient (after other authorized deductions) to permit deduction of the full amount of his or her payroll deduction election, then (i) the payroll deduction election for such payroll period shall be reduced to the amount of pay remaining, if any, after all other authorized deductions, and (ii) the percentage or dollar amount of Eligible Compensation shall be deemed to have been reduced by the amount of the reduction in the payroll deduction election for such payroll period.  Deductions of the full amount originally elected by the Participant will recommence as soon as his or her pay is sufficient to permit such payroll deductions; provided, however, no additional amounts will be deducted to satisfy the Outstanding Election.\nA Participant may elect to decrease, but not increase, the rate of his or her payroll deductions during an Offering Period by submitting the prescribed Enrollment Agreement to the Company (or the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s designee) at any time\n8\nprior to the first day of the last calendar month of such Offering Period.  Any such payroll deduction change will be effective as soon as administratively practicable thereafter and will remain in effect for successive Offering Periods as provided in Section (7) unless (i) the Participant submits a new Enrollment Agreement for a later Offering Period, (ii) the Participant elects to decrease his or her payroll deductions, (iii) the Participants elects to withdraw from the Plan in accordance with Section (9), (iv) the Participant is withdrawn from the Plan in accordance with Section (14), or (v) the Participant is otherwise ineligible to participate in the Plan.  A Participant may only increase his or her rate of payroll deductions to be effective for the next Offering Period by completing and filing with the Company a new Enrollment Agreement authorizing the payroll deductions.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may adjust a Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s payroll deductions at any time during an Offering Period to the extent necessary to comply with Section 423(b)(8) of the Code and the limitations of Section (5).  Payroll deductions will recommence and be made in accordance with the Outstanding Election in place prior to such Company adjustment starting with the first Offering Period that begins in the next calendar year (or such other time as is determined by the Administrator) unless (i) the Participant withdraws in accordance with Section (9), (ii) the Participant is withdrawn from the Plan in accordance with Section (14), or (iii) the Participant is otherwise ineligible to participate in the Plan.\n(9)\nWithdrawal from Offering Period After Offering Date.  An Eligible Employee may withdraw from any Offering Period after the applicable Offering Date, in whole but not in part, at any time prior to the date specified by the Administrator or, if no such date is specified by the Administrator, the last Trading Day of such Offering Period, by submitting the prescribed withdrawal notice to the Company (or the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s designee), in the format and pursuant to the process as prescribed by the Administrator.  If a Participant withdraws from an Offering Period, the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Option for such Offering Period will automatically be terminated, and the Company will refund in cash the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entire Account balance for such Offering Period as soon as practicable thereafter.  A Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s withdrawal from a particular Offering Period shall be irrevocable.  If a Participant wishes to participate in a subsequent Offering Period, he or she must re-enroll in the Plan by timely submitting a new Enrollment Agreement in accordance with Section (6).\n(10)\nPurchase of Stock.  On the last Trading Day of each Offering Period, the Administrator shall cause the amount credited to each Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Account to be applied to purchase as many Shares (or, as applicable, fractions of a Share) pursuant to the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Option as possible at the Purchase Price Per Share, subject to limitations of Sections (3) and (5).  In no event may Shares be purchased pursuant to an Option more than twenty-seven (27) months after the Offering Date of such Option.  The amount applied to purchase Shares pursuant to the Option shall be deducted from the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Account.  Any amounts remaining credited to the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Account on the last Trading Day of the Offering Period shall be retained in the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Account and rolled forward to the next Offering Period.\n9\n(11)\nInterest on Payments.  No interest shall be paid on sums withheld from a Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pay for the purchase of Shares under this Plan unless otherwise determined necessary by the Administrator.\n(12)\nRights as Shareholder.  A Participant will not be a shareholder or have any rights as a shareholder with respect to Shares subject to the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Options issued under the Plan until the Shares are purchased pursuant to the Options and such Shares are transferred into the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name on the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s books and records.\n(13)\nOptions Not Transferable.  A Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Options under this Plan may not be sold, pledged, assigned, or transferred in any manner.  If a Participant sells, pledges, assigns, or transfers his or her Options in violation of this Section (13), such Options shall immediately terminate, and the Participant shall immediately receive a refund of the amount then credited to the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Account.\n(14)\nDeemed Cancellations.\n(a)\nTermination of Service.  In the event of a Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Termination of Service, (i) any outstanding Option held by the Participant shall immediately terminate; (ii) the Participant shall be withdrawn from the Plan; and (iii) the Participant shall receive a refund of the amount then credited to the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Account.\n(b)\nDeath of a Participant.  If a Participant dies, (i) any outstanding Option held by the Participant shall immediately terminate, and (ii) the Participant shall be withdrawn from the Plan.  As soon as administratively practicable after the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death, the amount then credited to the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Account shall be remitted to the executor, administrator, or other legal representative of the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s estate or, if the Administrator permits a beneficiary designation, to the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by the Participant if such designation has been filed with the Company or the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s designee before such Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death.  If such executor, administrator, or other legal representative of the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s estate has not been appointed (to the knowledge of the Company) or if the beneficiary or beneficiaries are no longer living at the time of the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death, the Company, in its discretion, may deliver the outstanding Account balance to the spouse or to any one or more dependents or relatives of the Participant or to such other person as the Company may designate.\n(15)\nApplication of Funds.  All funds received by the Company in payment for Shares purchased under this Plan and held by the Company at any time may be used for any valid corporate purpose.\n(16)\nNo Employment/Service Rights.  Neither the action of the Company in establishing the Plan, nor any action taken under the Plan by the Board or the Administrator, nor any provision of the Plan itself, shall be construed so as to\n10\ngrant any person the right to remain in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary for any period of specific duration, and such person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s employment may be terminated at any time, with or without cause.\n(17)\nAdjustments.  Subject to Section (18), upon (or, as may be necessary to effect the adjustment, immediately prior to) any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a stock split in the form of a stock dividend) or reverse stock split; any merger, combination, consolidation, or other reorganization; any spin-off, split-up, or similar extraordinary dividend distribution in respect of the Common Stock; or any exchange of Common Stock or other securities of the Company or any similar, unusual, or extraordinary corporate transaction in respect of the Common Stock, in each case, then the Administrator shall equitably and proportionately adjust (1) the number, amount, and type of Shares of Common Stock (or other securities) that thereafter may be made the subject of Options (including the specific Share limits, maximums, and numbers of Shares set forth elsewhere in the Plan), (2) the number, amount, and type of Shares of Common Stock (or other securities or property) subject to any outstanding Options, (3) the Purchase Price Per Share of any outstanding Options, and/or (4) the securities, cash, or other property deliverable upon exercise or payment of any outstanding Options, in each case to the extent necessary to preserve (but not increase) the level of incentives intended by the Plan and the then-outstanding Options.\nIt is intended that, if possible, any adjustments contemplated by the preceding paragraph be made in a manner that satisfies applicable legal, tax (including, without limitation and as applicable in the circumstances, Section 424 of the Code and Section 409A of the Code), and accounting (so as to not trigger any charge to earnings with respect to such adjustment) requirements.\nWithout limiting the generality of Section (4), any good faith determination by the Administrator as to whether an adjustment is required in the circumstances pursuant to this Section (17), and the extent and nature of any such adjustment, shall be final, conclusive, and binding on all persons.\n(18)\nMerger or Liquidation of Company.  In the event the Company or its shareholders enter into an agreement to dispose of all or substantially all of the assets or outstanding capital stock of the Company by means of a sale, merger, or reorganization in which the Company will not be the surviving corporation (other than a reorganization effected primarily to change the State in which the Company is incorporated, a merger or consolidation with a wholly-owned Subsidiary, or any other transaction in which there is no substantial change in the shareholders of the Company or their relative stock holdings, regardless of whether the Company is the surviving corporation) or in the event the Company is liquidated, then all outstanding Options under the Plan shall automatically be exercised immediately prior to the consummation of such sale, merger, reorganization, or liquidation (deemed the end of the Offering Period in such case) by causing all amounts credited to each Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Account to be applied to purchase as many Shares pursuant to the Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Option as possible at the Purchase Price Per Share, subject to the limitations of Sections (3) and (5).\n11\n(19)\nAcquisitions and Dispositions.  The Administrator may, in its sole and absolute discretion and in accordance with principles under Section 423 of the Code, create special Offering Periods for individuals who become Eligible Employees solely in connection with the acquisition of another company or business by merger, reorganization, or purchase of assets, and notwithstanding Section (14), may provide for special purchase dates for Participants who will cease to be Eligible Employees solely in connection with the disposition of all or a portion of any Designated Subsidiary or a portion of the Company, which Offering Periods and purchase rights granted pursuant thereto shall, notwithstanding anything stated herein, be subject to such terms and conditions as the Administrator considers appropriate in the circumstances.\n(20)\nGovernment Approvals or Consents.  This Plan and any offering and sales of Shares or delivery of Shares under this Plan to Eligible Employees hereunder are subject to any governmental or regulatory approvals or consents that may be or become applicable in connection therewith.\n(21)\nPlan Amendment, Suspension, and Termination.  The Board may, from time to time, amend, suspend, or terminate the Plan in any manner it deems necessary or advisable; provided, however, that no such action shall adversely affect any then outstanding and vested Options under the Plan unless such action is required to comply with Applicable Laws; and provided, further, that no such action of the Board shall be effective without the approval of the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shareholders if such approval is required by Applicable Laws.  Upon the termination of the Plan, any balance in a Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Account shall be refunded to him or her as soon as practicable thereafter.\n(22)\nGoverning Law.  The Plan shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of California (except its choice-of-law provisions) and applicable U.S. Federal laws.\n12",

The Plan was further amended by the Board as set forth herein, effective November 6, 2024.  For the terms and conditions of the Plan applicable to an Award, refer to the version of the Plan in effect as of the date such Award was granted.\n1.\nPURPOSES\n.  The purposes of the Plan are to retain the services of qualified individuals who are not employees of the Company to serve as members of the Board and to secure for the Company the benefits of the incentives inherent in increased Common Stock ownership by such individuals by granting such individuals Awards in respect of Shares.\n2.\nADMINISTRATION\n.  The Administrator shall be responsible for administering the Plan.  Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Administrator shall have the full authority, in its sole discretion, to take any actions it deems necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan, including but not limited to:\n(a)\ndetermining the Fair Market Value for purposes of any Award;\n(b)\napproving any forms of Award Agreements to be used under the Plan;\n(c)\namending any outstanding Awards;\n(d)\nconstruing and interpreting the Plan and any agreements defining the rights and obligations of the Company and Non-Employee Directors under the Plan;\n(e)\ncorrecting any defect, supplying any omission or reconciling any inconsistency in the Plan or any Award Agreement;\n(f)\nadopting such rules or guidelines as it deems appropriate to implement the Plan;\n(g)\nauthorizing any person to execute on behalf of the Company any instrument required to effect the grant of an Award previously authorized by the Administrator or the Plan;\n(h)\nadjusting the number of shares subject to any Award, adjusting the price of any or all outstanding Options or otherwise changing previously imposed terms and conditions, in such circumstances as the Administrator may deem appropriate;\n(i)\ndetermining whether, and the extent to which, adjustments are required pursuant to Section 7 hereof; and\n(j)\nmaking all other decisions relating to the operation of the Plan.\nEach interpretation, determination, or other action made or taken by the Administrator pursuant to the Plan shall be final and binding on all persons, and the Administrator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s determinations under the Plan need not be the same for all persons.  The Administrator shall not be liable for any action or determination made in good faith, and shall be entitled to indemnification and reimbursement in the manner provided in the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws as such documents may be amended from time to time.\n1\n3.\nSHARES AVAILABLE; LIMITS\n.\n(a)\nSHARE LIMIT\n.  Subject to the provisions of Section 7, the maximum number of Shares that may be issued under the Plan shall not exceed 11,200,000 Shares (the \u00e2\u0080\u009c\nShare Limit\n\u00e2\u0080\u009d).  The stock issuable under the Plan shall be authorized and unissued Shares.\n(b)\nSHARE COUNT\n.  Shares issued pursuant to Restricted Stock Unit Awards shall count against the Share Limit as two (2) Shares for every one (1) Share issued in connection with the Award.  Shares issued pursuant to the exercise of Options shall count against the Share Limit as one (1) Share for every one (1) Share to which such exercise relates.  If Awards are settled in cash, the shares that would have been delivered had there been no cash settlement shall not be counted against the Share Limit.  Except as provided in the next sentence, if Awards are forfeited or are terminated for any reason before settlement or exercise, then the Shares underlying such Awards shall again become available for Awards under the Plan, provided that any one (1) Share subject to a Restricted Stock Unit Award that is forfeited or terminated shall be credited as two (2) Shares when determining the number of Shares that shall again become available for Awards under the Plan.  Shares that are exchanged by a Non-Employee Director or withheld by the Company as full or partial payment in connection with any Award under the Plan, as well as any Shares exchanged by a Non-Employee Director or withheld by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to any Award, shall not be available for subsequent Awards under the Plan.\n(c)\nLIMIT ON COMPENSATION.\nIn no event shall the compensation payable by the Company to a Non-Employee Director for services performed as a Non-Employee Director, including the grant date value (determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) of Awards, cash retainers, and other compensation, exceed $1,500,000 in the aggregate in any fiscal year.\n4.\nRESTRICTED STOCK UNITS\n.  Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, each Non-Employee Director shall receive grants of Restricted Stock Units under the Plan subject to the following provisions of this Section 4 and the terms of any Award Agreement approved by the Administrator:\n(a)\nANNUAL GRANTS\n.  On the date of each Annual Meeting immediately following which a Non-Employee Director is serving on the Board, such Non-Employee Director shall be automatically granted an Award of a number of Restricted Stock Units determined by dividing (i) $310,000 (or such other amount as determined by the Board and subject to the limitations of the Plan) by (ii)\u00c2\u00a0the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of grant, such number to be rounded to the nearest whole number of Restricted Stock Units (each, an \u00e2\u0080\u009c\nAnnual RSU Award\n\u00e2\u0080\u009d).\n(b)\nINITIAL GRANTS\n.  Each Non-Employee Director who first becomes a Non-Employee Director at any time other than on the date of an Annual Meeting shall be automatically granted, on the date he or she first becomes a Non-Employee Director, an Award of a number of Restricted Stock Units determined by multiplying (i) the quotient obtained by dividing (A)\u00c2\u00a0the dollar amount applied under Section 4(a) with respect to Awards granted at the immediately preceding Annual Meeting by (B)\u00c2\u00a0the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of grant, by (ii) a fraction (A)\u00c2\u00a0the numerator of which shall be the number of days remaining in the 365-day period following the most recent Annual Meeting, and (B)\u00c2\u00a0the denominator of which shall be 365 (but in no event shall such fraction be greater than one (1)), such number to be rounded to the nearest whole number of Restricted Stock Units (each, an \u00e2\u0080\u009c\nInitial RSU Award\n\u00e2\u0080\u009d); provided, however, that a Non-Employee Director shall not be eligible to receive an Initial RSU Award if either (x) he or she was an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to first becoming a Non-Employee Director, or (y) he or she first becomes a Non-Employee Director at any time on or after the February 1 following the last preceding Annual Meeting.\n2\n(c)\nVESTING; TERMINATION OF SERVICE\n.  Except as otherwise provided in an Award Agreement at the time of grant, each Annual RSU Award shall fully vest on the February 1 that occurs in the fiscal year of the Company following the fiscal year in which the Award was granted.  Each Initial RSU Award shall fully vest on the Vesting Date established for the Annual RSU Awards granted in connection with the last Annual Meeting to occur prior to the grant date of such Initial RSU Award.  If the Non-Employee Director ceases to serve as a member of the Board for any reason other than the Non-Employee Director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death, the Non-Employee Director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Restricted Stock Units shall terminate to the extent such Restricted Stock Units have not become vested prior to the first date the Non-Employee Director is no longer a member of the Board, and the Non-Employee Director shall have no rights with respect to, or in respect of, such terminated Restricted Stock Units.  If the Non-Employee Director ceases to serve as a member of the Board due to his or her death, the Non-Employee Director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unvested Restricted Stock Units shall fully vest as of the date of the Non-Employee Director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death.\n(d)\nSETTLEMENT OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS\n.  On or as soon as administratively practical following the applicable Vesting Date (and in all events not later than two and one-half months after the applicable Vesting Date), the Company shall deliver to the Non-Employee Director a number of Shares (as evidenced by an appropriate entry on the books of the Company or a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company) equal to the number of Restricted Stock Units that vested on the applicable Vesting Date.  Upon settlement of any Restricted Stock Units in accordance with the foregoing provision of this Section 4(d) and settlement of any Dividend Equivalent Right in accordance with Section 4(f), the Non-Employee Director shall have no further rights with respect to any Restricted Stock Units that are so paid.\n(e)\nSHAREHOLDER RIGHTS\n.  A Non-Employee Director shall have no rights as a shareholder of the Company, no dividend rights (except as expressly set forth in Section 4(f) with respect to Dividend Equivalent Rights) and no voting rights with respect to the Restricted Stock Units or any Shares underlying or issuable in respect of such Restricted Stock Units until such Shares have been issued to the Non-Employee Director pursuant to Section 4(d).  Except for any Dividend Equivalent Rights awarded pursuant to Section 4(f) or as provided in Section 7, no adjustment shall be made in respect of any Restricted Stock Units for dividends or distributions or other rights in respect of any share for which the record date is prior to the date upon which the Non-Employee Director shall become the holder of record of Shares related thereto.\n(f)\nDIVIDEND EQUIVALENT RIGHTS DISTRIBUTIONS\n.  As of any date that the Company pays an ordinary cash dividend on its Common Stock, the Company shall credit the Non-Employee Directors with a dollar amount equal to (i) the per Share cash dividend paid by the Company on its Common Stock on such date, multiplied by (ii) the total number of Restricted Stock Units (including as such total number may be adjusted pursuant to Section 7) subject to the Award that are outstanding immediately prior to the record date for that dividend (a \u00e2\u0080\u009c\nDividend Equivalent Right\n\u00e2\u0080\u009d).  Any Dividend Equivalent Rights credited pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 4(f) shall be subject to the same vesting, settlement and other terms, conditions and restrictions as the Restricted Stock Units to which they relate; provided, however, that the amount of any vested Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be paid in cash.  No crediting of Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be made pursuant to this Section 4(f) with respect to any Restricted Stock Units which, immediately prior to the record date for that dividend, have either been paid pursuant to Section 4(d) or terminated pursuant to Section 4(c).\n5.\nOPTIONS.\n(a)\nNO ADDITIONAL GRANTS\n.  No Options shall be granted under the Plan unless and until the Board determines that the grant of Options is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.\n3\n(b)\nEXERCISE PRICE\n.

The date of exercise of an Option shall be the later of (A)\u00c2\u00a0the date on which the Company receives such written notice and (B)\u00c2\u00a0the date on which the Non-Employee Director pays the applicable consideration pursuant to Section 5(e)(ii).\nii.\nMETHOD OF EXERCISE\n.  The consideration to be paid for the Shares to be issued upon exercise of an Option may consist of (A)\u00c2\u00a0cash, (B)\u00c2\u00a0check, (C)\u00c2\u00a0other Shares that have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as to which the Option shall be exercised, (D)\u00c2\u00a0delivery of a properly executed exercise notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to sell Shares and promptly deliver to the Company the amount of proceeds required to pay the exercise price, or (E)\u00c2\u00a0any combination of the foregoing methods of payment.  Without limiting the generality of the\n4\nforegoing, any vested and exercisable Options may also be Net Exercised, to the extent permitted by the Administrator.\niii.\nSHAREHOLDER RIGHTS\n.  A Non-Employee Director shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to any Shares issuable upon exercise of an Option until such Shares shall have been issued to the Non-Employee Director pursuant to Section 5(e), and, except as provided in Section 7, no adjustment shall be made to an Option or Share issued upon the exercise thereof for dividends, distributions or other rights in respect of any Share for which the record date is prior to the date upon which the Non-Employee Director shall become the holder of record thereof.\n(f)\nISSUANCE OF SHARES\n.  Subject to the foregoing conditions, as soon as is reasonably practicable after its receipt of a proper notice of exercise and, if applicable, payment of the exercise price of the Option for the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised, the Company shall deliver to the Non-Employee Director (or following the Non-Employee Director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death, the Beneficiary entitled to exercise the Option), at the principal office of the Company or at such other location as may be acceptable to the Company and the Non-Employee Director (or such Beneficiary), the appropriate number of Shares to be issued in connection with such exercise.  Delivery of such Shares shall be evidenced by an appropriate entry on the books of the Company or a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company, or in such other manner that the Administrator shall specify from time to time.

An Option shall be exercisable, during the Non-Employee Director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lifetime, only by the Non-Employee Director or by the individual or entity to whom the Option has been transferred in accordance with the previous sentence.  No assignment or transfer of an Award, or of the rights represented thereby, whether voluntary or involuntary, by operation of law or otherwise, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, shall vest in the assignee or transferee any interest or right in the Award, but immediately upon any attempt to assign or transfer the Award the same shall terminate and be of no force or effect.\n7.\nADJUSTMENTS\n.\n(a)\nUpon (or, as may be necessary to effect the adjustment, immediately prior to)  any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a stock split in the form of a stock dividend) or reverse stock split; any merger, combination, consolidation or other reorganization; any spin-off, split-up, split-off or extraordinary dividend distribution in respect of the Common Stock; or any exchange of Common Stock or other securities of the Company, or any similar, unusual or extraordinary corporate transaction in respect of the Common Stock, the Administrator shall equitably and proportionately adjust (1)\u00c2\u00a0the number and type of Shares (or other securities) that thereafter may be made the subject of Awards (including the Share Limit, maximums and number of Shares set forth elsewhere in the Plan), (2)\u00c2\u00a0the number, amount and type of Shares (or other securities or property) subject to any outstanding Awards, (3)\u00c2\u00a0the exercise price of any outstanding Options, and/or (4)\u00c2\u00a0the securities, cash or other property deliverable upon exercise or settlement of any outstanding Awards, in each case to the extent necessary to preserve (but not increase) the level of incentives intended by the Plan and the then-outstanding Awards.  Any good faith determination by the Administrator as to whether an adjustment is required in the\n5\ncircumstances pursuant to this Section 7(a), and the extent and nature of any such adjustment, shall be conclusive and binding on all persons.\n(b)\nIt is intended that, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, any adjustments contemplated by Section 7(a) be made in a manner that satisfies applicable legal, tax (including, without limitation and as applicable in the circumstances, Code Section\u00c2\u00a0409A) and accounting (so as to not\ntrigger any charge to earnings with respect to such adjustment) requirements.\n(c)\nAny adjustment under this Section 7 need not be the same for all persons or Awards.\n8.\nCHANGE OF CONTROL\n.  Upon the occurrence of any Change of Control, any then outstanding Award automatically shall become vested or exercisable, as the case may be, with respect to a prorated portion of the number of Shares subject to such Award, determined as follows:\n(a)\nCLIFF-VESTING AWARDS.\nIf the Award has one scheduled Vesting Date, the portion of the Award with respect to the following number of Shares shall vest upon the Change of Control:  (i)\u00c2\u00a0the number of Shares subject to such Award, multiplied by (ii)\u00c2\u00a0a fraction (A)\u00c2\u00a0the numerator of which is the number of days elapsed from and including the date the Award was granted to the date of the Change of Control, and (B)\u00c2\u00a0the denominator is the number of days from and including the date of grant to and including the scheduled Vesting Date.\n(b)\nINSTALLMENT-VESTING AWARDS.\nIf the Award has multiple scheduled Vesting Dates, the portion of the Award with respect to the following number of Shares shall vest upon the Change of Control:  (i)\u00c2\u00a0the number of Shares subject to the portion of such Award that is scheduled to vest on the first Vesting Date that is scheduled to occur following the Change of Control, multiplied by (ii)\u00c2\u00a0a fraction (A)\u00c2\u00a0the numerator of which is the number of days elapsed following and excluding the most recent Vesting Date prior to the Change of Control, and (B)\u00c2\u00a0the denominator is the number of days from and excluding such most recent Vesting Date to and including the first Vesting Date that is scheduled to occur following the Change of Control.\n9.\nDESIGNATION OF BENEFICIARY\n.\n(a)\nBENEFICIARY DESIGNATIONS\n.  Each Non-Employee Director may designate a Beneficiary to exercise an Option or receive settlement of an Award upon the Non-Employee Director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death by executing a Beneficiary Designation Form and delivering it to the Administrator.\n(b)\nCHANGE OF BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION\n.  A Non-Employee Director may change an earlier Beneficiary designation by executing a later Beneficiary Designation Form and delivering it to the Administrator.  The execution of a Beneficiary Designation Form and its receipt by the Administrator shall revoke and rescind any prior Beneficiary Designation Form.\n10.\nTERMINATION AND AMENDMENT OF THE PLAN\n.\n(a)\nTERMINATION\n.  Unless earlier terminated by the Board, the Plan shall terminate on November 12, 2027.

For avoidance of doubt, the Board may, without shareholder approval, provide on a prospective basis for grants under the Plan to consist of Options only, Restricted Stock Units only, or a combination of Options and Restricted Stock Units on such terms and conditions, subject to the Share Limit and the other express limits of the Plan, as may be established by the Board.\n(c)\nWHEN NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS\u00e2\u0080\u0099 CONSENTS REQUIRED\n.  The Board may not alter, amend, suspend or terminate the Plan, or amend the terms of any outstanding Award, without the consent of any Non-Employee Director to the extent that such action would adversely affect his or her rights with respect to Awards that have previously been granted, except to the extent such action is necessary to comply with applicable law or stock exchange listing rules or accounting rules.\n(d)\nNO REPRICING\n.  In no case (except due to an adjustment contemplated by Section 7 or any repricing that may be approved by shareholders) shall any action be taken with respect to the Plan or any Option hereunder that would constitute a repricing (by amendment, substitution, cancellation and regrant, exchange or other means, including any action that is treated as a repricing under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) of the per Share exercise price of any Option.\n11.\nMISCELLANEOUS\n.\n(a)\nNO RIGHT TO NOMINATION\n.

The Administrator may require each Non-Employee Director or any other person purchasing or acquiring Shares pursuant to the Plan to agree with the Company in writing that such Non-Employee Director is acquiring the Shares for investment and not with a view to the distribution thereof or provide such other assurances and representations to the Company as the Administrator may deem necessary or desirable to assure compliance with all applicable legal and accounting requirements.  Shares delivered under the Plan shall be subject to such stock-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Administrator may deem advisable under the rules, regulations and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission or any exchange upon which the Common Stock is then listed, and any applicable federal or state securities law.  No Shares shall be issued hereunder unless the Company shall have determined that such issuance is in compliance with, or pursuant to an exemption from, all applicable federal and state securities laws.\n(c)\nEXPENSES\n.  The costs and expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by the Company.\n7\n(d)\nAPPLICABLE LAW\n.  Except as to matters of federal law, the Plan and all actions taken thereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without giving effect to conflicts of law principles.\n(e)\nSEVERABILITY.\nIf a court of competent jurisdiction holds any provision invalid and unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Plan shall continue in effect.\n(f)\nSECTION HEADINGS; INTERPRETATION\n.  Captions and headings are given to the sections and subsections of the Plan solely as a convenience to facilitate reference.  Such headings shall not be deemed in any way material or relevant to the construction or interpretation of the Plan or any provision thereof.\n(g)\nAUTHORITY OF THE COMPANY AND SHAREHOLDERS\n.

Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Administrator shall have the full authority, in its sole discretion, to take any actions it deems necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan, including but not limited to:\n(a)\ndetermining the Fair Market Value for purposes of any Award;\n(b)\napproving any forms of Award Agreements to be used under the Plan;\n(c)\namending any outstanding Awards;\n(d)\nconstruing and interpreting the Plan and any agreements defining the rights and obligations of the Company and Non-Employee Directors under the Plan;\n(e)\ncorrecting any defect, supplying any omission or reconciling any inconsistency in the Plan or any Award Agreement;\n(f)\nadopting such rules or guidelines as it deems appropriate to implement the Plan;\n(g)\nauthorizing any person to execute on behalf of the Company any instrument required to effect the grant of an Award previously authorized by the Administrator or the Plan;\n(h)\nadjusting the number of shares subject to any Award, adjusting the price of any or all outstanding Options or otherwise changing previously imposed terms and conditions, in such circumstances as the Administrator may deem appropriate;\n(i)\ndetermining whether, and the extent to which, adjustments are required pursuant to Section 7 hereof; and\n(j)\nmaking all other decisions relating to the operation of the Plan.\nEach interpretation, determination, or other action made or taken by the Administrator pursuant to the Plan shall be final and binding on all persons, and the Administrator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s determinations under the Plan need not be the same for all persons.  The Administrator shall not be liable for any action or determination made in good faith, and shall be entitled to indemnification and reimbursement in the manner provided in the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws as such documents may be amended from time to time.\n1\n3.\nSHARES AVAILABLE; LIMITS\n.\n(a)\nSHARE LIMIT\n.  Subject to the provisions of Section 7, the maximum number of Shares that may be issued under the Plan shall not exceed 11,200,000 Shares (the \u00e2\u0080\u009c\nShare Limit\n\u00e2\u0080\u009d).  The stock issuable under the Plan shall be authorized and unissued Shares.\n(b)\nSHARE COUNT\n.  Shares issued pursuant to Restricted Stock Unit Awards shall count against the Share Limit as two (2) Shares for every one (1) Share issued in connection with the Award.  Shares issued pursuant to the exercise of Options shall count against the Share Limit as one (1) Share for every one (1) Share to which such exercise relates.  If Awards are settled in cash, the shares that would have been delivered had there been no cash settlement shall not be counted against the Share Limit.  Except as provided in the next sentence, if Awards are forfeited or are terminated for any reason before settlement or exercise, then the Shares underlying such Awards shall again become available for Awards under the Plan, provided that any one (1) Share subject to a Restricted Stock Unit Award that is forfeited or terminated shall be credited as two (2) Shares when determining the number of Shares that shall again become available for Awards under the Plan.  Shares that are exchanged by a Non-Employee Director or withheld by the Company as full or partial payment in connection with any Award under the Plan, as well as any Shares exchanged by a Non-Employee Director or withheld by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to any Award, shall not be available for subsequent Awards under the Plan.\n(c)\nLIMIT ON COMPENSATION.\nIn no event shall the compensation payable by the Company to a Non-Employee Director for services performed as a Non-Employee Director, including the grant date value (determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) of Awards, cash retainers, and other compensation, exceed $1,500,000 in the aggregate in any fiscal year.\n4.\nRESTRICTED STOCK UNITS\n.  Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, each Non-Employee Director shall receive grants of Restricted Stock Units under the Plan subject to the following provisions of this Section 4 and the terms of any Award Agreement approved by the Administrator:\n(a)\nANNUAL GRANTS\n.  On the date of each Annual Meeting immediately following which a Non-Employee Director is serving on the Board, such Non-Employee Director shall be automatically granted an Award of a number of Restricted Stock Units determined by dividing (i) $310,000 (or such other amount as determined by the Board and subject to the limitations of the Plan) by (ii)\u00c2\u00a0the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of grant, such number to be rounded to the nearest whole number of Restricted Stock Units (each, an \u00e2\u0080\u009c\nAnnual RSU Award\n\u00e2\u0080\u009d).\n(b)\nINITIAL GRANTS\n.  Each Non-Employee Director who first becomes a Non-Employee Director at any time other than on the date of an Annual Meeting shall be automatically granted, on the date he or she first becomes a Non-Employee Director, an Award of a number of Restricted Stock Units determined by multiplying (i) the quotient obtained by dividing (A)\u00c2\u00a0the dollar amount applied under Section 4(a) with respect to Awards granted at the immediately preceding Annual Meeting by (B)\u00c2\u00a0the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of grant, by (ii) a fraction (A)\u00c2\u00a0the numerator of which shall be the number of days remaining in the 365-day period following the most recent Annual Meeting, and (B)\u00c2\u00a0the denominator of which shall be 365 (but in no event shall such fraction be greater than one (1)), such number to be rounded to the nearest whole number of Restricted Stock Units (each, an \u00e2\u0080\u009c\nInitial RSU Award\n\u00e2\u0080\u009d); provided, however, that a Non-Employee Director shall not be eligible to receive an Initial RSU Award if either (x) he or she was an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to first becoming a Non-Employee Director, or (y) he or she first becomes a Non-Employee Director at any time on or after the February 1 following the last preceding Annual Meeting.\n2\n(c)\nVESTING; TERMINATION OF SERVICE\n.  Except as otherwise provided in an Award Agreement at the time of grant, each Annual RSU Award shall fully vest on the February 1 that occurs in the fiscal year of the Company following the fiscal year in which the Award was granted.  Each Initial RSU Award shall fully vest on the Vesting Date established for the Annual RSU Awards granted in connection with the last Annual Meeting to occur prior to the grant date of such Initial RSU Award.  If the Non-Employee Director ceases to serve as a member of the Board for any reason other than the Non-Employee Director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death, the Non-Employee Director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Restricted Stock Units shall terminate to the extent such Restricted Stock Units have not become vested prior to the first date the Non-Employee Director is no longer a member of the Board, and the Non-Employee Director shall have no rights with respect to, or in respect of, such terminated Restricted Stock Units.  If the Non-Employee Director ceases to serve as a member of the Board due to his or her death, the Non-Employee Director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unvested Restricted Stock Units shall fully vest as of the date of the Non-Employee Director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death.\n(d)\nSETTLEMENT OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS\n.  On or as soon as administratively practical following the applicable Vesting Date (and in all events not later than two and one-half months after the applicable Vesting Date), the Company shall deliver to the Non-Employee Director a number of Shares (as evidenced by an appropriate entry on the books of the Company or a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company) equal to the number of Restricted Stock Units that vested on the applicable Vesting Date.  Upon settlement of any Restricted Stock Units in accordance with the foregoing provision of this Section 4(d) and settlement of any Dividend Equivalent Right in accordance with Section 4(f), the Non-Employee Director shall have no further rights with respect to any Restricted Stock Units that are so paid.\n(e)\nSHAREHOLDER RIGHTS\n.  A Non-Employee Director shall have no rights as a shareholder of the Company, no dividend rights (except as expressly set forth in Section 4(f) with respect to Dividend Equivalent Rights) and no voting rights with respect to the Restricted Stock Units or any Shares underlying or issuable in respect of such Restricted Stock Units until such Shares have been issued to the Non-Employee Director pursuant to Section 4(d).  Except for any Dividend Equivalent Rights awarded pursuant to Section 4(f) or as provided in Section 7, no adjustment shall be made in respect of any Restricted Stock Units for dividends or distributions or other rights in respect of any share for which the record date is prior to the date upon which the Non-Employee Director shall become the holder of record of Shares related thereto.\n(f)\nDIVIDEND EQUIVALENT RIGHTS DISTRIBUTIONS\n.  As of any date that the Company pays an ordinary cash dividend on its Common Stock, the Company shall credit the Non-Employee Directors with a dollar amount equal to (i) the per Share cash dividend paid by the Company on its Common Stock on such date, multiplied by (ii) the total number of Restricted Stock Units (including as such total number may be adjusted pursuant to Section 7) subject to the Award that are outstanding immediately prior to the record date for that dividend (a \u00e2\u0080\u009c\nDividend Equivalent Right\n\u00e2\u0080\u009d).  Any Dividend Equivalent Rights credited pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 4(f) shall be subject to the same vesting, settlement and other terms, conditions and restrictions as the Restricted Stock Units to which they relate; provided, however, that the amount of any vested Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be paid in cash.  No crediting of Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be made pursuant to this Section 4(f) with respect to any Restricted Stock Units which, immediately prior to the record date for that dividend, have either been paid pursuant to Section 4(d) or terminated pursuant to Section 4(c).\n5.\nOPTIONS.\n(a)\nNO ADDITIONAL GRANTS\n.  No Options shall be granted under the Plan unless and until the Board determines that the grant of Options is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.\n3\n(b)\nEXERCISE PRICE\n.  The per share exercise price of each Option shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a Share as of the date of grant of the Option determined in accordance with the provisions of the Plan.\n(c)\nVESTING\n.  Except as otherwise provided in an Award Agreement at the time of grant, Options shall be fully vested and immediately exercisable on their date of grant.\n(d)\nTERM OF OPTIONS\n.\ni.\nTEN-YEAR TERM\n.  Each Option shall expire ten (10) years from its date of grant, subject to earlier termination as provided herein.\nii.\nTERMINATION OF SERVICE\n.  Upon cessation of a Non-Employee Director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s service as a member of the Board for any reason other than death, any of the Non-Employee Director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Options (or any portion thereof) that is not then vested shall terminate, and the Non-Employee Director shall have no rights with respect to, or in respect of, such terminated Options.  If the Non-Employee Director ceases to serve as a member of the Board due to his or her death, the Non-Employee Director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Options shall fully vest as of the date of the Non-Employee Director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death.\niii.\nEXERCISE FOLLOWING TERMINATIONS OF SERVICE\n.  If a Non-Employee Director ceases to be a member of the Board for any reason other than death, any Options granted to such Non-Employee Director that are exercisable at the time of the Non-Employee Director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s termination may be exercised by such Non-Employee Director at any time within ninety (90) days after the date of such Non-Employee Director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s termination of service, subject to the earlier expiration of such Options as provided for in Section 5(d)(i) above.  At the end of such ninety-day period, any unexercised portion of the Option shall expire.  If a Non-Employee Director ceases to be a member of the Board by reason of his or her death, all of the Options granted to the Non-Employee Director may be exercised by his or her Beneficiary at any time within three (3) years after the date of the Non-Employee Director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death, subject to the earlier expiration of such Options as provided for in Section 5(d)(i) above.  At the end of such three-year period, any unexercised portion of the Option shall expire.\n(e)\nTIME AND MANNER OF EXERCISE OF OPTIONS\n.\ni.\nNOTICE OF EXERCISE\n.  Subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, a Non-Employee Director may exercise any Option, to the extent such Option is vested, by giving written notice of exercise to the Company; provided, however, that in no event shall an Option be exercisable for a fractional share.  The date of exercise of an Option shall be the later of (A)\u00c2\u00a0the date on which the Company receives such written notice and (B)\u00c2\u00a0the date on which the Non-Employee Director pays the applicable consideration pursuant to Section 5(e)(ii).\nii.\nMETHOD OF EXERCISE\n.  The consideration to be paid for the Shares to be issued upon exercise of an Option may consist of (A)\u00c2\u00a0cash, (B)\u00c2\u00a0check, (C)\u00c2\u00a0other Shares that have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as to which the Option shall be exercised, (D)\u00c2\u00a0delivery of a properly executed exercise notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to sell Shares and promptly deliver to the Company the amount of proceeds required to pay the exercise price, or (E)\u00c2\u00a0any combination of the foregoing methods of payment.  Without limiting the generality of the\n4\nforegoing, any vested and exercisable Options may also be Net Exercised, to the extent permitted by the Administrator.\niii.\nSHAREHOLDER RIGHTS\n.  A Non-Employee Director shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to any Shares issuable upon exercise of an Option until such Shares shall have been issued to the Non-Employee Director pursuant to Section 5(e), and, except as provided in Section 7, no adjustment shall be made to an Option or Share issued upon the exercise thereof for dividends, distributions or other rights in respect of any Share for which the record date is prior to the date upon which the Non-Employee Director shall become the holder of record thereof.\n(f)\nISSUANCE OF SHARES\n.  Subject to the foregoing conditions, as soon as is reasonably practicable after its receipt of a proper notice of exercise and, if applicable, payment of the exercise price of the Option for the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised, the Company shall deliver to the Non-Employee Director (or following the Non-Employee Director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death, the Beneficiary entitled to exercise the Option), at the principal office of the Company or at such other location as may be acceptable to the Company and the Non-Employee Director (or such Beneficiary), the appropriate number of Shares to be issued in connection with such exercise.  Delivery of such Shares shall be evidenced by an appropriate entry on the books of the Company or a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company, or in such other manner that the Administrator shall specify from time to time.  Shares sold in connection with a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccashless exercise\u00e2\u0080\u009d shall be delivered to the broker referred to therein in accordance with procedures established by the Company from time to time.\n6.\nRESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER\n.  An Award may not be transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise disposed of, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution; provided, however, that, with the approval of the Administrator\n,\nan Award may be transferred to a Non-Employee Director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family members or to one or more trusts established in whole or in part for the benefit of one or more of such family members.  An Option shall be exercisable, during the Non-Employee Director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lifetime, only by the Non-Employee Director or by the individual or entity to whom the Option has been transferred in accordance with the previous sentence.  No assignment or transfer of an Award, or of the rights represented thereby, whether voluntary or involuntary, by operation of law or otherwise, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, shall vest in the assignee or transferee any interest or right in the Award, but immediately upon any attempt to assign or transfer the Award the same shall terminate and be of no force or effect.\n7.\nADJUSTMENTS\n.\n(a)\nUpon (or, as may be necessary to effect the adjustment, immediately prior to)  any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a stock split in the form of a stock dividend) or reverse stock split; any merger, combination, consolidation or other reorganization; any spin-off, split-up, split-off or extraordinary dividend distribution in respect of the Common Stock; or any exchange of Common Stock or other securities of the Company, or any similar, unusual or extraordinary corporate transaction in respect of the Common Stock, the Administrator shall equitably and proportionately adjust (1)\u00c2\u00a0the number and type of Shares (or other securities) that thereafter may be made the subject of Awards (including the Share Limit, maximums and number of Shares set forth elsewhere in the Plan), (2)\u00c2\u00a0the number, amount and type of Shares (or other securities or property) subject to any outstanding Awards, (3)\u00c2\u00a0the exercise price of any outstanding Options, and/or (4)\u00c2\u00a0the securities, cash or other property deliverable upon exercise or settlement of any outstanding Awards, in each case to the extent necessary to preserve (but not increase) the level of incentives intended by the Plan and the then-outstanding Awards.  Any good faith determination by the Administrator as to whether an adjustment is required in the\n5\ncircumstances pursuant to this Section 7(a), and the extent and nature of any such adjustment, shall be conclusive and binding on all persons.\n(b)\nIt is intended that, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, any adjustments contemplated by Section 7(a) be made in a manner that satisfies applicable legal, tax (including, without limitation and as applicable in the circumstances, Code Section\u00c2\u00a0409A) and accounting (so as to not\ntrigger any charge to earnings with respect to such adjustment) requirements.\n(c)\nAny adjustment under this Section 7 need not be the same for all persons or Awards.\n8.\nCHANGE OF CONTROL\n.  Upon the occurrence of any Change of Control, any then outstanding Award automatically shall become vested or exercisable, as the case may be, with respect to a prorated portion of the number of Shares subject to such Award, determined as follows:\n(a)\nCLIFF-VESTING AWARDS.\nIf the Award has one scheduled Vesting Date, the portion of the Award with respect to the following number of Shares shall vest upon the Change of Control:  (i)\u00c2\u00a0the number of Shares subject to such Award, multiplied by (ii)\u00c2\u00a0a fraction (A)\u00c2\u00a0the numerator of which is the number of days elapsed from and including the date the Award was granted to the date of the Change of Control, and (B)\u00c2\u00a0the denominator is the number of days from and including the date of grant to and including the scheduled Vesting Date.\n(b)\nINSTALLMENT-VESTING AWARDS.\nIf the Award has multiple scheduled Vesting Dates, the portion of the Award with respect to the following number of Shares shall vest upon the Change of Control:  (i)\u00c2\u00a0the number of Shares subject to the portion of such Award that is scheduled to vest on the first Vesting Date that is scheduled to occur following the Change of Control, multiplied by (ii)\u00c2\u00a0a fraction (A)\u00c2\u00a0the numerator of which is the number of days elapsed following and excluding the most recent Vesting Date prior to the Change of Control, and (B)\u00c2\u00a0the denominator is the number of days from and excluding such most recent Vesting Date to and including the first Vesting Date that is scheduled to occur following the Change of Control.\n9.\nDESIGNATION OF BENEFICIARY\n.\n(a)\nBENEFICIARY DESIGNATIONS\n.  Each Non-Employee Director may designate a Beneficiary to exercise an Option or receive settlement of an Award upon the Non-Employee Director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death by executing a Beneficiary Designation Form and delivering it to the Administrator.\n(b)\nCHANGE OF BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION\n.  A Non-Employee Director may change an earlier Beneficiary designation by executing a later Beneficiary Designation Form and delivering it to the Administrator.  The execution of a Beneficiary Designation Form and its receipt by the Administrator shall revoke and rescind any prior Beneficiary Designation Form.\n10.\nTERMINATION AND AMENDMENT OF THE PLAN\n.\n(a)\nTERMINATION\n.  Unless earlier terminated by the Board, the Plan shall terminate on November 12, 2027.  Following such date, no further grants of Awards shall be made pursuant to the Plan.\n(b)\nGENERAL POWER OF BOARD\n.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Board may at any time and from time to time terminate, modify, suspend or amend the Plan in whole or in part (including amend the Plan at any time and from time to time, without\n6\nshareholder approval, to prospectively change the value and relative mixture of Restricted Stock Units and Options subject to Awards granted to Non-Employee Directors on the date of each Annual Meeting or upon becoming a Non-Employee Director and the methodology for determining the number of Shares to be subject to such Awards, each within the Share Limit and the individual limit set forth in Section 3, and the other terms and conditions applicable to such Awards) or, subject to Sections\u00c2\u00a010(c) and 10(d), amend the terms of any outstanding Award; provided, however, that no such termination, modification, suspension or amendment shall be effective without shareholder approval if such approval is required to comply with any applicable law or stock exchange rule; and provided further that the Board may not, without shareholder approval, increase the maximum number of Shares issuable under the Plan except as provided in Section 7.  For avoidance of doubt, the Board may, without shareholder approval, provide on a prospective basis for grants under the Plan to consist of Options only, Restricted Stock Units only, or a combination of Options and Restricted Stock Units on such terms and conditions, subject to the Share Limit and the other express limits of the Plan, as may be established by the Board.\n(c)\nWHEN NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS\u00e2\u0080\u0099 CONSENTS REQUIRED\n.  The Board may not alter, amend, suspend or terminate the Plan, or amend the terms of any outstanding Award, without the consent of any Non-Employee Director to the extent that such action would adversely affect his or her rights with respect to Awards that have previously been granted, except to the extent such action is necessary to comply with applicable law or stock exchange listing rules or accounting rules.\n(d)\nNO REPRICING\n.  In no case (except due to an adjustment contemplated by Section 7 or any repricing that may be approved by shareholders) shall any action be taken with respect to the Plan or any Option hereunder that would constitute a repricing (by amendment, substitution, cancellation and regrant, exchange or other means, including any action that is treated as a repricing under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) of the per Share exercise price of any Option.\n11.\nMISCELLANEOUS\n.\n(a)\nNO RIGHT TO NOMINATION\n.  Nothing in the Plan shall be deemed to create any obligation on the part of the Board to nominate any of its members for reelection by the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shareholders, nor confer upon any Non-Employee Director the right to remain a member of the Board for any period of time, or at any particular rate of compensation.\n(b)\nREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\n.  The Administrator may require each Non-Employee Director or any other person purchasing or acquiring Shares pursuant to the Plan to agree with the Company in writing that such Non-Employee Director is acquiring the Shares for investment and not with a view to the distribution thereof or provide such other assurances and representations to the Company as the Administrator may deem necessary or desirable to assure compliance with all applicable legal and accounting requirements.  Shares delivered under the Plan shall be subject to such stock-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Administrator may deem advisable under the rules, regulations and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission or any exchange upon which the Common Stock is then listed, and any applicable federal or state securities law.  No Shares shall be issued hereunder unless the Company shall have determined that such issuance is in compliance with, or pursuant to an exemption from, all applicable federal and state securities laws.\n(c)\nEXPENSES\n.  The costs and expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by the Company.\n7\n(d)\nAPPLICABLE LAW\n.  Except as to matters of federal law, the Plan and all actions taken thereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without giving effect to conflicts of law principles.\n(e)\nSEVERABILITY.\nIf a court of competent jurisdiction holds any provision invalid and unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Plan shall continue in effect.\n(f)\nSECTION HEADINGS; INTERPRETATION\n.  Captions and headings are given to the sections and subsections of the Plan solely as a convenience to facilitate reference.  Such headings shall not be deemed in any way material or relevant to the construction or interpretation of the Plan or any provision thereof.\n(g)\nAUTHORITY OF THE COMPANY AND SHAREHOLDERS\n.  The existence of the Plan shall not affect or restrict in any way the right or power of the Company or the shareholders of the Company to make or authorize (i) any adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other change in the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capital structure or business of the Company or any Subsidiary, (ii) any merger, amalgamation, consolidation or change in the ownership of the Company or any Subsidiary, (iii) any issue of bonds, debentures, capital, preferred or prior preference stock ahead of or affecting the capital stock (or the rights thereof) of the Company or any Subsidiary, (iv) any dissolution or liquidation of the Company or any Subsidiary, (v) any sale or transfer of all or any part of the assets or business of the Company or any Subsidiary, (vi) the payment at the discretion of the Board of any type or form of compensation to Non-Employee Directors that may be made at law and without contravention of any requirement of the principal exchange upon which the Shares are traded, or (vii) any other corporate act or proceeding by the Company or any Subsidiary, whether of a similar character or otherwise.  No Non-Employee Director, beneficiary or other person shall have any claim under any Award or Award Agreement against any member of the Board or the Company, or any employees, officers or agents of the Company or any Subsidiary, as a result of any such action.\n12.\nDEFINITIONS\n.
